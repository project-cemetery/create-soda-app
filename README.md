The easiest way to create a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) app with server-side rendering thanks to [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

## Overview

```sh
npm install -g create-next-app

create-next-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your running app.
When you're ready for production, run `npm run build` then `npm run start`.

### Start Coding Now

You **don't** need to install or setup Webpack or Babel.
They come packaged with `next`, so you can just start coding.

After running `create-soda-app`, you're good to go!

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install it once globally:

```sh
yarn add global create-next-app
```

or

```sh
npm install -g create-soda-app
```

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

**You don't need to use Node as your primary backend**. The Node installation is only required for Create Next App and running the Next.js server in development/production.

### Creating an App

To create a new app, run:

```
create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install necessary dependencies:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  package.json
  next.config.js
  components/
    index.js
    head.js
    nav.js
  pages/
    index.js
  static/
    favicon.ico
```

Routing in Next.js is based on the file system, so `./pages/index.js` maps to the `/` route and
`./pages/about.js` would map to `/about`.

The `./static` directory maps to `/static` in the `next` server, so you can put all your
other static resources like images or compiled CSS in there.

Out of the box, we get:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- Hot code reloading
- Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
- Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/`

Once the installation is finished, you can run some commands in your project:

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`npm run build\` first.

Now you're ready to code & deploy your app!

## Starting from Examples

There are a ton of examples in the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/) (and growing!) that you can use to bootstrap your app.

To use an example:

1. Go to https://open.segment.com/create-next-app#examples
2. Search for an example you want and get it's name (looks like `basic-css`)
3. Run: `create-next-app --example basic-css example-app`
4. Done 💥
